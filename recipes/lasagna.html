      <li>1 bunch of dried basil leaves</li>

      <li>Fennel seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
        slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
        the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
        cutting; this helps it set and firm up.
      </li>
    </ol>
